        <h1>Aims and Scope</h1>
        <p>
            The primary goal of this journal is to publish high-quality research articles related to engineering and its
            associated technologies. Frontiers of Engineering and Emerging Technologies (FEE-TECH) covers a broad
            spectrum of topics within the engineering field, including innovations and advancements in engineering
            practices, tools, and methodologies; strategies and practices for effective engineering project management;
            economic analysis and evaluation of engineering projects, such as cost-benefit assessments, financial
            management, and economic impact studies; the development, analysis, and implications of policies influencing
            engineering practices and technological progress; research on sustainable energy solutions, renewable energy
            technologies, and the transition from fossil fuels to cleaner energy sources; studies addressing the
            environmental impact of engineering projects, sustainable development, and eco-friendly engineering
            approaches; and interdisciplinary research bridging engineering with other scientific and technological
            domains. By encompassing these diverse areas, FEE-TECH seeks to contribute to the advancement of engineering
            knowledge and practice, promoting the development of innovative solutions to contemporary challenges
